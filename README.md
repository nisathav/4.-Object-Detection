# 4.-Object-Detection-ROS2

We have the following detection in the systems, 
1. YOLO detection system - https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
   This is a real time object detection system.
   The available YOLO detection algorithms are darknet, yolov3 or yolov4
   
3. Object detection with RVIZ - https://www.stereolabs.com/docs/ros/object-detection/
   This is a 3D visualization tool used in the ROS. It visualize sensor data, robot states and other information in 3D environment. 

Remark: combining the above two will provide real-time visualization of detected objects in a 3D environment.
